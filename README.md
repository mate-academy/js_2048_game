## Introduction
To begin with, let me please present to you the project I have been working on. This is the 2048 game which is a popular puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. My implementation of the game is built using JavaScript mostly and utilizes a variety of tools and methods to create a smooth and engaging gaming experience based on JS.

## addEventListener
I also used the addEventListener method to listen for user input from the keyboard. This allowed us to capture arrow key presses and use them to move the tiles on the game board.

## Logical operators
Such logical operators s as && and || I used extensively throughout the code to create branching logic that determined how the game behaved in different situations. For example, I used logical operators to check whether two adjacent tiles could be combined or whether the game had been won or lost.

## Math.floor(), Math.random()
The Math.floor() method was used in the mix with Math.random() to round down the result of division operations to ensure that we always get a whole number of the tile on the game board. I used the Math.random() method to generate random numbers for new tiles numbers that appeared on the board.

## Array [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2] 
This approach has been used to get a chance of the number 4 as 1:10 or 10%.

## Loops
Loops were used extensively throughout the code to iterate over the game board and perform various operations on the tiles. For example, I used one, but complex loop inside of the function that accepts multiple parameters to check whether a tile could be moved in a particular direction (vertically and horizontally) and to generate or remove new tiles when necessary.

## classList.add()
To manipulate the appearance of the game board, I used the classList.add() method to add and remove CSS classes from HTML elements. This allowed me to highlight tiles that had been combined and to change the color of tiles with different numbers.

## Recursive function
A recursive function was used to implement the core game logic, where tiles were combined and moved based on user input. This function called itself repeatedly to move tiles until no more moves were possible or, in other words, until the condition is truthful.

## functions
Finally, I used functions extensively throughout the code to encapsulate different pieces of logic and make the code more modular and easier to understand. For example, I created functions to move tiles in different directions, combine adjacent tiles, and check whether the game had been won or lost.

## Summary
Overall, my implementation of the 2048 game showcases my proficiency with a wide range of JavaScript tools and methods, including event listeners, logical operators, math functions, recursion, loops, class manipulation, and function creation.

Building this game with JavaScript was a breeze! It was so easy, it's like child's play... or should I say, like playing 2048 itself!
