# 2048 Game

Welcome to my 2048 game project! This is a classic puzzle game implemented in JavaScript. In this game, you need to combine tiles with the same numbers to reach the elusive 2048 tile.

Check out the [DEMO LINK](https://pushkarskiyrodion.github.io/js_2048_game/) to see the live version of the 2048 Game.

The game is inspired by the original [2048 game](https://play2048.co/) created by Gabriele Cirulli.

## How to Play

+ Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or swipe gestures (for touch devices) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
+ All tiles will slide in the chosen direction until they reach the edge of the grid or collide with another tile.
+ When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum.
+ After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear on the grid.
+ The game ends when there are no more possible moves (i.e., the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles can be combined).
+ Your objective is to reach the 2048 tile by combining tiles and achieving the highest score possible.

## Technologies Used

+ JavaScript: The game logic and user interaction are implemented using JavaScript.
+ HTML: The game interface and structure are built with HTML.
+ CSS: The game styling and layout are handled using CSS.
