# 2048 game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game’s objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

# Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass (SCSS)
- JavaScript
- LoDash

# Game logic

- The game field is 4 x 4 (16 cells), but it can be easily changed to any size in code
- Each cell can be empty or contain one of the numbers: 2, 4, 8 ... 2^n
- The game starts with 2 cells filled with 2 or 4
- The game can be started by clicking the `Start` button
- The player can move cells with keyboard arrows
- All the numbers are moved in the selected direction until all empty cells are filled in
   - 2 equal cells are merged into a doubled number
   - The merged cell can’t be merged twice during one move
- The move is possible if at least one cell is changed after the move
- After move 2 or 4 appears in a random empty cell. 4 probability is 10%
- When `2048` value is displayed in any cell, win message will be shown.
- The `game over` message will be shown if there are no more available moves.
- Score is increased by the sum of all merged cells.
- High score is saved in local storage.
- The game can be restarted by clicking the `Restart` button.

# Reflections

The main goal of this project was to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulations and combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS.

The main challenge was to implement the game logic. I had to think about all possible scenarios and how to implement them.

Eventually I practiced in building more complex logic using knowledge I have gained so far until this point.

### This project is inspired by original [2048 game](https://play2048.co/)
