A feature of 2048 is that the entire playing field moves to the border, and not individual columns or lines. After each such move, a new tile of denomination "2" (with a probability of 90%) or "4" (with a probability of 10%) appears on a random empty cell. The game is considered lost if you have no moves left (all cells are filled with "knuckles", there is no way to combine them). To win the game, you need to collect a tile with a face value of "2048".

The game also provides for scoring - the sum of all the tiles connected during the game.

The game field is 4 x 4.
Each cell can be empty or contain one of the numbers: 2, 4, 8 ... 2^n.
The player can move cells with keyboard arrows.
