 I created a fully functional 2048 game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS(Sass).The game logic was implemented using JavaScript, with the ability to move tiles and merge them according to the rules of the game.To add interactivity to the game, I used JavaScript event listeners to detect user input, such as swipes and arrow key presses, and then used algorithms to determine the movement and merging of tiles. The game also includes a scoring system and the ability to restart the game at any time.
